# ðŸ“² WhatsApp Unread Message Extractor â€“ Automation Bot

This Python automation script extracts unread messages from WhatsApp Web using Selenium. It works by using a saved Chrome user session to skip QR logins after the first time and filters chats by unread messages using the green bubble count. The script reads each unread chat and saves details like contact name/number, message, timestamp, and unread count into a CSV file.
